Features:
Input Handling: Accepts input for marks obtained in each subject.
Total Marks Calculation: Calculates the sum of marks obtained in all subjects.
Average Percentage Calculation: Computes the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the total number of subjects.
Grade Assignment: Assigns grades based on the average percentage achieved.
Results Display: Presents the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.


How to Use:
Enter the marks obtained in each subject when prompted.
The program will calculate the total marks and average percentage automatically.
Based on the average percentage, the program will assign a corresponding grade.
Results, including total marks, average percentage, and grade, will be displayed to the user.
